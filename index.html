      <p>Festival of Neighbourhoods invites you to create opportunities to connect with your neighbours - plan a simple gathering or activities, start a neighbourhood project, or work with others to host events in your neighbourhoods that bring people together. These activities can grow into family, neighbourhood, and community traditions, just like Festival of Neighbourhoods has become part of the tradition and strength of our community!</p>
      <p><strong>Deadline to register your activities for this season is October 5th 2015. All activities held between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015 can be eligible for prizes and awards.</strong></p>

      <p>Festival of Neighbourhoods is a longstanding Kitchener initiative celebrating all acts of neighbourly kindness that are exchanged throughout a year. It is the belief in neighbourhoods and the power of connections in a physical space we inhabit that initiated this unique tradition in 1994.</p>

    <blockquote>You plan for ways to bring neighbours together! We plan for ways to support you!</blockquote>

    <div class="container">
      <p>Festival of Neighbourhoods invites citizens to plan activities, projects, gatherings or events in their neighbourhoods that bring people together and are open to everyone.  Committed to building healthy communities, Festival of Neighbourhoods encourages people to build stronger relationships with their neighbours.</p>
